%%  Task 5: Feasible Trajectory Dataset Generation via Iterative Optimization  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Input Shape: 
%      Please check the MATLAB Workspace after running it once

% Output Shape: 
%      trajectory:    8xN (N is the iteration steps you took to reach)
%

function trajectory = generateIK(robot, lambda, q0, targetPosition, maxJointSpeed, toleranceDistance, dt)
    trajectory = []; % 8xN array with 4 joints position and 4 joints speed
