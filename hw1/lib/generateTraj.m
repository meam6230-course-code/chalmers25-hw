% Input Shape: 
%      Please check the MATLAB Workspace after running it once

% Output Shape: 
%      optimal_solution_final:    
%      should include fields same as optimal_solution_full and optimal_solution_after_disturbance (Topt, Xopt, Yopt, MVopt)
%

function optimal_solution_final = generateTraj(disturbance_idx, optimal_solution_full, optimal_solution_after_disturbance)
    optimal_solution_final = [];
